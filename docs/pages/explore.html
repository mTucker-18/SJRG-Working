          <h3><strong>Northern Taurids Meteor Shower</strong></h3>
          <p>When: October 20 - December 10 (peak: Nov 11-12th)</p>
          <p>This shower is much like the Southern Taurids, just active a bit later in the year.
            When the two showers are active simultaneously in late October and early November,
            there is sometimes an notable increase in the fireball activity. There seems to be
            a seven year periodicity with these fireballs. 2008 and 2015 both produced remarkable
            fireball activity!</p>
          <p>For more information check out the American Meteor Society's website

        <h1>Outdoor Fun</h1>
        <p><strong>Hiking</strong></p>
        <p>There are more than 22 miles of hiking and riding trail opportunities
          providing families, anglers and mountain bikers with beautiful fall,
          winter and spring scenic vistas.</p>
        <!-- <p>Nature Trail</p> -->
        <!-- <p>San Joaquin River Trail</p> -->
        <p>Scenic trails on the Madera County side of the gorge offer a six-mile
          hiking loop along the ridge with a four-mile trail along the river. A
          portion of the sixteen-mile San Joaquin River Trail is on the Fresno
          County side connected by a bridge.</p>

        <p><strong>Camping</strong></p>
        <p>There are a few different types of campsites available:</p>

        <p>Our smaller, family camp site is "Yeh-Gub-Weh-Tuh" which means Place
          of Blue Oak in the Mono language. This area consists of six different
          walk-in sites, two of which are wheelchair accessible. Each site
          accomodates up to eight people. These have water, garbage, a double
          vault toilet and a paved parking area. This area also serves as the main
          trailhead.</p>

        <p>We have two larger group camp sites in the "Aholul Group Campground
          and Day Use Area". They accomodate 250 people total and are accessible a
          short distance from the paved parking area close to the horse camp.
          There are six large picnic tables, two large fire rings and a double vault
          toilet.</p>

        <p><strong>First Peoples</strong></p>
        <p>The area is within prehistoric boundaries of two Yokuts ("Kechayi" and
          "Dumna") and two Western Monache (Western Mono and North Fork Mono) tribes.
          Some members of these tribes still use the area today.</p>
        <p>Indigenous Village - Explore a reproduction of a village with a sweat lodge,
          Cedar bark houses and an acorn granary.</p>
        <p>Acorn Prep Rock - A nearby bedrock mortar acorn processing site used to
          prepare food.</p>

        <p><strong>Equestrian Camp</strong></p>
        <p>For those interested in the Equestrian Campground, it is accessible by vehicle
        and has water, garbage and a portable toilet. The corral area is a four stall,
        fenced-in, pole corral that has a large unpaved parking area.</p>
