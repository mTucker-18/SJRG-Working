        <h1>What's Here to Explore</h1>
        <p>In a deep canyon near the geographic center of California, the San
          Joaquin River Gorge divides Fresno and Madera Counties with 6,770 acres
          ready for hiking, picnicking, hunting, kayaking, biking, exploring nature,
          and equestrian, family and group campsites.</p>
        <p>Scenic trails on the Madera County side of the river offer a six-mile
          hiking loop along the ridge with a four-mile trail along the river.
          The sixteen-mile San Joaquin River Trail begins on the Fresno side.</p>
        <p>Discover displays, a gift shop, an outdoor classroom and occasional
          guided programs at the Visitor Center.</p>
        <p>Explore a reproduction of an indigenous village with sweat lodge, cedar
          bark houses and an acorn granary. Stroll down a nature trail offering an
          array of native plants used by indigenous ancestors. Investigate a
          bedrock mortar acorn-processing site and a simulated archaeological
          excavation station.</p>
        <p>There is something for everyone to discover, have fun and enjoy year
          round!</p>
